# Drowsy-Driver-Assistant
Standalone Drowsiness Detection And Alarm Management  by Raspberry Pi 3


Done as Partial Fulfillment of 
the Requirement for 4 Year B.Tech. Degree in 
Instrumentation Engineering from 
Department of Applied Physics, University of Calcutta

Supervised by Dr. Ujjwal Mondal, Department of Applied Physics, University of Calcutta

Involves implementation of iBUG (Intelligent behaviour 
understanding group)-300W data file, consisting of 68 pairs of integer values — these values are the (x, y)-coordinates of the facial 
structures with researchers manually and painstakingly 
annotating and labeling each of the 68 coordinates on a total of 7,764 images as a base for the algorithm 

Study of requirements of such an algorithm 

Literature review of works published over the years and analysis of the accuracy and drawbacks of each

Acquiring Knowledge about python programming for computer vision and image processing, implementation of Cascade classifiers

Designing a plan of work that involves operation of the algorithm to infer degree of inactivity based on eye motion and yawn detection and taking appropriate action

Writing the algorithm in python and testing accross a variety of conditions based on scientific research and intuition with modifications as per requirements.

Final Implementation on Debian and Windows and determining key areas of improvement.Done as Partial Fulfillment of the Requirement for 4 Year B.Tech.
